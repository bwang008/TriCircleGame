# 🎲 TriCircleGame

A visually engaging probability game where you bet on geometry and chance!

## 🕹️ Game Overview

TriCircleGame is a web-based game of chance and intuition. The game starts with a circle and three colored dots rotating around its edge at random speeds and directions. After a set period (default: **5 seconds**), the dots stop, and lines are drawn between them to form a triangle.

Your challenge: **Will the center of the circle be inside or outside the triangle?**  
Place your bet and see if your prediction pays off!
